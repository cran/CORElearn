Description: This is a suite of machine learning algorithms written in C++ with R 
 interface. It contains several machine learning model learning techniques in 
 classification and regression, for example classification and regression trees with
 optional constructive induction and models in the leaves, random forests, kNN, 
 naive Bayes, and locally weighted regression. All predictions obtained with these
 models can be explained and visualized with ExplainPrediction package.  
 The package is especially strong in feature evaluation where it contains several variants of
 Relief algorithm and many impurity based attribute evaluation functions, e.g., Gini, 
 information gain, MDL, and DKM. These methods can be used for example to discretize 
 numeric attributes.
 Its additional feature is OrdEval algorithm and its visualization used for evaluation
 of data sets with ordinal features and class, enabling analysis according to the 
 Kano model of customer satisfaction. 
 Several algorithms support parallel multithreaded execution via OpenMP.  
 The top-level documentation is reachable through ?CORElearn.
